# Unsupervised-Clustering-Analysis-on-Diabetes-Patient-Data-Using-K-Means
#This project applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to a real-world diabetes dataset to explore how artificial intelligence can assist in medical data analysis. Using Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas, I implemented K-Means clustering to group patients based on key health indicators. The dataset was preprocessed through data imputation and normalization, and the optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method and validated with evaluation metrics like the Silhouette Score. This work demonstrates how computational tools and AI can uncover hidden patterns in patient data, supporting better understanding and potential decision-making in healthcare contexts.
